# Stegosaur

Welcome to Stegosaur!

Stegosaur is a proof-of-concept QR Code x Image steganography application built to run on Android.
The app allows users to generate QR codes from text using the Zxing library, and then allows the user to hide this QR code and its information into an image.
An image can then be run through the decoding algorithm to retrieve the hidden information.

This project is no longer being updated.
